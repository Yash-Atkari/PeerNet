## üõ†Ô∏è Local Setup Instructions

### üìÅ Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yash-Atkari/PeerNet.git
cd peernet
```
### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
Create a .env file:
```bash
PORT=5000
ATLASDB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
```
Start the server:
```bash
node server.js
```
The backend will run on: `http://localhost:5000`
### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
cd peernet-project
```
Create a .env file:
```bash
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:5000
```
Start the frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The frontend will run on: `http://localhost:5173`

Note: Currently, the deployed version of the project is facing functionality issues. While both the frontend and backend have been successfully deployed on different platforms, the application is not working as expected in the deployed environment. This may be due to configuration issues, incorrect API endpoints, or CORS-related problems. I am actively working on identifying and resolving the issue. The local version of the project works correctly.
